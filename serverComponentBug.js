In Next.js 15, a rather uncommon error arises when using server components with a complex data fetching logic that involves multiple asynchronous operations and nested promises. The error might not be immediately obvious in the console, but it often manifests as an unexpected data state or missing data in the server component's output. This is because if a promise in this complex operation rejects, the error might not be properly caught or handled by the overall server component, leading to unexpected behavior.  For example, if one API call fails within a chain of `Promise.all`, the entire chain might fall without proper error handling, and the server component won't render correctly. This is particularly tricky to debug because the error might not appear in the client-side console, but rather silently result in incomplete or incorrect data.
