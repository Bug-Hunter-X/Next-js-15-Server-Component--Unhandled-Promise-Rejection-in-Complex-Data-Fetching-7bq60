# Next.js 15 Server Component: Unhandled Promise Rejection in Complex Data Fetching

This repository demonstrates a bug and its solution related to unhandled promise rejections within complex asynchronous data fetching logic in Next.js 15 server components.  The bug results in unexpected data states or missing data due to silent failures within a chain of asynchronous operations.

## Bug Description

When fetching data from multiple sources within a Next.js 15 server component, improper error handling in a chain of asynchronous operations (e.g., using `Promise.all` without comprehensive error handling) can lead to unexpected behavior. A rejected promise might not be caught, causing the server component to render incompletely or incorrectly without clear error messages in the console.

## Solution

The solution involves robust error handling within the asynchronous data fetching logic, using `.catch` blocks to handle rejected promises and providing appropriate fallback mechanisms or error messages.
